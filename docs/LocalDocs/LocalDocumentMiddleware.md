# Middleware

Middlewares are one of the important components of the Vue.js framework that allow application code and functionality to be modeled and reused. Middlewares are implemented as predefined or hand-made functions and are inserted as mediators between functions and different parts of the program. Next, we explain the efficiency and benefits of these components in Vue.js projects:

### Middleware efficiency:
1. Modification and filtering of requests: Through middleware, you can change or filter incoming requests to the program. This is useful when you may need to make changes to requests (such as adding a specific header to all requests).

2. Management of program state and mode: Through middlewares, you can manage the states of your program and apply the required changes. For example, if you need to perform a similar operation on all pages, middlewares allow you to define the code for this operation once and use it on all pages.

3. Performing operations before and after each root: Using middleware, you can easily implement operations that are performed before entering each root (such as user authentication) or after exiting each root (such as registering contact information). do.

## Benefits of middleware:

1. Keeping the code simple: Using middleware, you can separate code parts related to different operations, and this makes your code simpler, more understandable and more manageable.

2. Code reuse: One of the most important benefits of middleware is the ability to reuse code and specific functions in the program. It allows you to place the pieces of code that are repeated intermittently in the middleware and prevent them from repeating.

3. Isolation of operations: Using middleware, you can manage operations and program logic separately. This makes programming more modular and flexible, making changes and updates easier to implement.

4. Prevent repetition: By using middleware, you can prevent the repetition of similar codes and operations in different parts of the program, and this reduces errors and improves the efficiency of the program.

In general, middleware is a powerful tool in Vue.JS that allows you to reduce code duplication, design applications in a modular way, and isolate different functions, which help improve code efficiency, functionality, and maintainability.
