# Layout config
One of the features of this project is the possibility of defining a series of special configurations for the layout of each page of the site in routes.js.

In this project, we have made it possible to define in the routes.js file, in addition to defining the unique addresses of each page, a special configuration can be defined for how to arrange the general elements on that page.
