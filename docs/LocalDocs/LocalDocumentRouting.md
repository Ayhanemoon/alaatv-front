# Routing

Routing is one of the most critical components in web application development, giving you powerful features like managing pages, navigating between them, using parameters and markers, and validation. By using routing, design Vue.js applications in a more organized and manageable way and provide a better user experience.


Routing in Vue.JS refers to creating different routes in web applications and creating connections between routes and components. By using routing, you can move between different pages of the program and use more special features such as parameters and indicators (query parameters) in the URL. In Vue.js, you can use Vue Router, which is an official plugin that allows you to route in Vue.js applications.


How routing works in Vue.js :
When the user enters a specific path in your application, Vue Router will detect the relevant path according to the requested URL address and display the component corresponding to that path. This component may contain a page or part of a page that is displayed in visible content.
Advantages of routing in Vue.js :

1. Convenient management of pages: Routing in Vue.js allows you to manage different pages of the application individually. This makes the code and components to be designed in a modular way, making them easier to maintain and develop.

2. Navigation between pages: By using routing, you can navigate between the pages of the program very easily and safely. Users can be transferred to different pages through different links and buttons and benefit from richer features such as indicators (query parameters).

3. Specifying parameters: Routing in Vue.js allows you to specify parameters and additional information as part of the URL address. This information can be used in the specified path and affect the way components are displayed and function.

4. Markers: Through markers, you can store additional information in the URL and manage application-specific states through them. This feature allows you to display more complex application states as simple addresses for users.

5. Authentication: By using rooting, you can do authentication (Authorization) to access different parts of the program. This will ensure that only users with access permissions are allowed to access the paths and pages associated with them. According to the layout settings, which are explained in detail in the relevant section, a special layout is implemented for each route with its settings for the user.
